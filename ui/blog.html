		<p>I am the angriest puppy in the world. This has been scientifically proven in several clinical trials.</p> <p>   It's never too late to become the person you could be! Do Not Give Up.The beginning is always the hardest.You have the ability to choose which way you want to go. You have to believe great things   are going to happen in your life. Do everything you can - prepare, pray and achieve - to make it happen. Work hard for what you want because it won't come to you without a fight.
               </p>
                <p> You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive. In order to carry a positive action we must develop here a positive vision. No matter what you're going through, there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it may seem hard to get to it but you can do it and just keep working towards it and you'll find the positive side of things. Always Do Your Best. Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret. 
               </p>
